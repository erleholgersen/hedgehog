An R package of functions for personal use, inspired by [Hilary Parker's blogpost](https://hilaryparker.com/2013/04/03/personal-r-packages/). I started working on this in 2015, and have added functions as I've been exposed to new problems/ application areas through work and studies. 

At present, the package includes functions (in various states of completeness) for Monte Carlo integration, survival analysis, processing TCGA datasets, and generic helper functions.
